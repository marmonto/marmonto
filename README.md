  <summary>👈(click) ✌️ A pice of my history -in tec- </summary>
  <br />
  <p>
  ⌛ In my beginnings at Tec, C# .Net, Java, JavaScript, T-SQL, and UML made me a Developer. <br />
   I spent time on requirements, architectures, testing <br /> 
    and deep communication between clients and teams to code. <br /> 
   I moved to IT, beeing in charge of Windows and Linux Servers, security and networking. <br />
   I learned a lot, specially in HA-DR with clustering, backup strategies, <br />
    storage management and virtualization with Hyper-V and VMWare. <br />
   I soon started as Database Administrator by accident, <br />
    taking advange of my knowledge from my Dev days. <br />
   I was able to learn, design, apply, coordinate, monitor, scale, update-upgrade, <br />
    refactor, and improve database infrastructures for different companies. <br />
   Combine my knowledge in Dev, Sec, and Ops to build and scale infrastructures. <br />
  </p>

<br />
  <br />

<p>
  🤯 Each company, project, and team challenged me.  <br />
    I have been able to learn and differentiate myself by having the support of collegues and leaders, <br />
    projecting myself to become a better engineer, a team player and a team leader. <br />
  </p>

<p>
  🔥 I’m interested in: <br />
    , SLCD, DevSecOps + DataOps / DatabaseOps, CyberSecurity <br />
    , Data and Database Architecture, Design, Development, Release, and Administration <br />

    , Automation: Shell (PowerShell), Pipelines <br />
    , Azure DevOps - Azure Architecture and Design <br />

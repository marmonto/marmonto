```👋 Hello World!``` <br />
👨‍🚀 I’m Marlon { @marmonto }.

<br />

```⌛ About me```
<details>
  <summary>👈(click) ✌️ A pice of history -in tec- </summary>
  <br />
  <p>
  ⌛ In my beginnings at Tec, C# .Net, Java, JavaScript, T-SQL, and UML made me a Developer. <br />
  &emsp;I spent time on requirements, architectures, testing <br /> 
  &emsp;&emsp;and deep communication between clients and teams to code. <br /> 
  &emsp;I moved to IT, beeing in charge of Windows and Linux Servers, security and networking. <br />
  &emsp;I learned a lot, specially in HA-DR with clustering, backup strategies, <br />
  &emsp;&emsp;storage management and virtualization with Hyper-V and VMWare. <br />
  &emsp;I soon started as Database Administrator by accident, <br />
  &emsp;&emsp;taking advange of my knowledge from my Dev days. <br />
  &emsp;I was able to learn, design, apply, coordinate, monitor, scale, update-upgrade, <br />
  &emsp;&emsp;refactor, and improve database infrastructures for different companies. <br />
  &emsp;Combine my knowledge in Dev, Sec, and Ops to build and scale infrastructures. <br />
  </p>


  <br />
  <br />
  
  <p>
  🤯 Each company, project, and team challenged me.  <br />
  &emsp;&emsp;I have been able to learn and differentiate myself by having the support of collegues and leaders, <br />
  &emsp;&emsp;projecting myself to become a better engineer, a team player and a team leader. <br />
  </p>
  
  <p>
  🔥 I’m interested in: <br />
  &emsp;&emsp;, SLCD, DevSecOps + DataOps / DatabaseOps, CyberSecurity <br />
  &emsp;&emsp;, Data and Database Architecture, Design, Development, Release, and Administration <br />
  &emsp;&emsp;__: Database engines such as SQL Server, PostgreSQL, Oracle, MongoDB, neo4j, redist <br />
  &emsp;&emsp;, Automation: Shell (PowerShell), Pipelines <br />
  &emsp;&emsp;, Azure DevOps - Azure Architecture and Design <br />
  &emsp;&emsp;, Windows/Linux Server, Networking <br />
  </p>
  
  <p>
  🧠 I have expanded farther than technical stuff, <br />
  &emsp;&emsp; my curiosity lead me to learn about: <br />
  &emsp;&emsp;, Agile: Scrum + DevOps <br />
  &emsp;&emsp;, CMMI, PMI-PMP, <br />
  &emsp;&emsp;, DAMA <br />
  &emsp;&emsp;, Service Design, Design Thinking, UX/UI <br />
  </p>
  
</details>  

  <br />

  <p>
  🕵️ I am currently playing with tools, tecnologies and codes: <br />
  &emsp;&emsp;, Python for dev and data <br />
  &emsp;&emsp;, Rust for dev and "hard" coding <br />
  &emsp;&emsp;, Go for dev and automation <br />
  &emsp;&emsp;, Flutter for UI/UX <br />
  &emsp;&emsp;, practicing Git - GitHub <br />
  &emsp;&emsp;, Docker, Windows/Linux + Virtualization Recap.  <br />
    
  &emsp;&emsp;and <br />
  
  &emsp;&emsp;, Languages: English, German and French - for literature, poetry, history and culture.

  <details>
    <p>
    <summary>⌛ In my beginnings at Tec, C# .Net, Java, JavaScript, T-SQL, and UML made me a Developer. </summary>
    I spent time on requirements, architectures, testing, and deep communication between clients and teams to code.  <br />
    I moved to IT, beeing in charge of Windows and Linux Servers, security and networking. <br />
    I learned a lot, specially in HA-DR with clustering, backup strategies, storage management and virtualization with Hyper-V and VMWare. <br />
    I soon started as Database Administrator by accident, taking advange of my knowledge from my Dev days. <br />
    I was able to learn, design, apply, coordinate, monitor, scale, update-upgrade, refactor, and improve database infrastructures for different companies. <br />
    Combine my knowledge in Dev, Sec, and Ops to build and scale infrastructures. <br />
    </p>

  🤯 Each company, project, and team challenged me.  <br />
  I have been able to learn and differentiate myself by having the support of collegues and leaders, projecting myself to become a better engineer, a team player and a team leader. <br />
